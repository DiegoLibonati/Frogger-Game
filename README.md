## Description

I made a web page to play Frogger. Frogger is a traditional game of the frog trying to get to the other side of the map, in this case I made one among us. The first test will be to pass through a traffic full of ferraris and trucks, then you will have to dodge the bullets of two turrets and finally pass through a bridge that disappears and reappears. If you reach the red line, you win.
